# Sales-Analysis-Amazon-Products-year-2019

In this project I used a dataset that was downloaded by https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ and it contains 12 different csv files,
each for every month's sales on Amazon for different products.

## What is Sales Analytics?

Sales analytics is the practice of generating insights from sales data, trends, and metrics to set targets and forecast future sales performance. 
Sales analysis is mining your data to evaluate the performance of your sales team against its goals. It provides insights about the top performing 
and underperforming products/services, the problems in selling and market opportunities, sales forecasting, and sales activities that generate revenue. <br>
